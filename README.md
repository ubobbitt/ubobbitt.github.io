<p>This is the home page for Ursula Bobbitt.</p>
<p>I am taking this course as a requirement for my degree program, but
I hope to gain more from this experience.  I expect to gain a decent,
basic working knowledge of web development.  I expect to learn 
fundamentals that I can continue to build upon long after I complete
this course.  I also expect to develop an appreciation for the coding
that is involved in  displaying the web pages that I like to visit.
I am looking forward to learning a lot from this class this semester.
I think it will be fun.</p>
