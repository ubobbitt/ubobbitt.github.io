# IT 4203 Advanced Web Development

Hello everyone! My name is Ursula Bobbitt and I am a senior at Kennesaw State University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Enterprise Systems. I started out as a student at Southern Polytechnic State University and I am still working on the same degree. I anticipate graduating summer 2019. I am taking IT 4203 Advanced Web Development as one of my program requirements and I hope to gain a lot of knowledge that I can hopefully use to obtain a better job.
